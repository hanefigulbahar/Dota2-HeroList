A GraphQl-based application includes both server and client sides. On the server side, the desired data is retrieved from an API that contains a large amount of data. Through the use of the GraphQl language, the client can query this data as desired. As a result, unnecessary data traffic on the client side is avoided and only the desired data is retrieved to develop a fast and efficient application.
